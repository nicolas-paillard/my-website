		<h2>Spain</h2>
		<p>I had the oportunity a few times to go to Spain and I was everytime really happy to go in different cities. This country is really sunny, and the mood of the entire country is really worth it. I liked going on the beaches and eating tapas with my glass of coke. It really is a cool country.</p>

		<h2>Spanish</h2>
		<p>I'm not really good in languages in general and I consider that my spanish is better than my english. I still have a lot of progress to do but it's always a pleasure to learn new words that make me feel in Spain. I enjoy going in both class of Spanish in IESEG.</p>
